# When to Avoid RabbitMQ

## 1. High Message Throughput with Low Latency
**Use Case:**
- When the system needs to handle very high message throughput with extremely low latency.

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** A high-frequency trading platform where every microsecond counts.
- **Alternative Tool:** Apache Kafka
- **Reason:** Kafka is designed for high-throughput, low-latency message processing and can handle millions of messages per second with very low overhead.

## 2. Distributed Transactions
**Use Case:**
- When you need strong consistency and distributed transaction support across multiple services.

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** A banking application that requires atomic transactions across several microservices.
- **Alternative Tool:** Apache Pulsar or a database with strong transactional support like CockroachDB.
- **Reason:** RabbitMQ does not support distributed transactions natively. Tools like Apache Pulsar provide better support for such use cases with features like transactions and event streams.

## 3. Large Message Storage
**Use Case:**
- When the system needs to store large amounts of data in messages for a long period.

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** A video processing application where video files are sent as messages and need to be stored until processing.
- **Alternative Tool:** AWS S3 with AWS SNS/SQS
- **Reason:** RabbitMQ is not optimized for storing large messages. Using a combination of S3 for storage and SNS/SQS for messaging provides a more scalable and cost-effective solution.

## 4. Real-Time Analytics and Monitoring
**Use Case:**
- When you need to perform real-time data analytics and monitoring on a stream of incoming data.

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** A social media analytics platform analyzing user interactions in real time.
- **Alternative Tool:** Apache Flink or Apache Storm
- **Reason:** RabbitMQ is not designed for complex stream processing and real-time analytics. Tools like Apache Flink or Storm are built specifically for such use cases and provide powerful stream processing capabilities.

## 5. Simple Notification System
**Use Case:**
- When you need a simple and scalable notification system without complex message routing.

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** A system sending out push notifications to mobile devices.
- **Alternative Tool:** AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)
- **Reason:** AWS SNS is designed for sending notifications at scale and integrates seamlessly with other AWS services. It simplifies the process of sending notifications without the need for managing a message broker like RabbitMQ.

## 6. Long-Term Data Retention
**Use Case:**
- When you need to retain messages for a long duration for audit or compliance purposes.

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** A financial auditing system that needs to keep transaction logs for several years.
- **Alternative Tool:** Apache Kafka
- **Reason:** Kafka is designed for long-term data retention and can store messages on disk indefinitely. It also allows for replaying messages, which is useful for auditing purposes.

## 7. Event Sourcing
**Use Case:**
- When you need an event store that allows replaying and reprocessing events.

**Example:**
- **Scenario:** A system using event sourcing to maintain state changes and rebuild application state.
- **Alternative Tool:** EventStoreDB or Apache Kafka
- **Reason:** RabbitMQ is not designed for event sourcing and replaying events. EventStoreDB and Kafka provide better support for event sourcing patterns, including the ability to replay and persist events efficiently.

These examples highlight specific scenarios where RabbitMQ may not be the best fit and suggest alternative tools better suited for those use cases.
